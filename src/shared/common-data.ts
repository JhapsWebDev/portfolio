  aboutMe: `Hi, I’m Jhaps. With a decade of experience as a web developer, I’ve had the privilege of growing and contributing at three different companies, refining my skills and delivering impactful projects.

  At my core, I’m an optimist and grateful for the opportunities life offers and motivated to make a positive impact on the world. Cause I believe 'We only live once, so let’s make it count by creating meaningful experiences and leaving behind lasting, positive memories.`,
